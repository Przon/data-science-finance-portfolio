# finance-portfolio

A collection of projects and assignments from my Postgraduate in Data Science for Finance @ NOVA IMS.

This portfolio showcases key projects that apply data science techniques to financial data, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and econometric modeling. It includes both individual assignments and group collaborations, covering topics such as financial forecasting, risk analysis, and portfolio optimization.
